(124) - You have an application that uses Cloud Spanner as a backend database. The application has a very predictable traffic pattern. You want to automatically scale up or down the number of Spanner nodes depending on traffic. What should you do?

A. Create a cron job that runs on a scheduled basis to review Cloud Monitoring metrics, and then resize the Spanner instance accordingly.
B. Create a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to send an alert to oncall SRE emails when Cloud Spanner CPU exceeds the threshold. SREs would scale resources up or down accordingly.
C. Create a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to send an alert to Google Cloud Support email when Cloud Spanner CPU exceeds your threshold. Google support would scale resources up or down accordingly.
**D. Create a Cloud Monitoring alerting policy to send an alert to webhook when Cloud Spanner CPU is over or under your threshold. Create a Cloud Function that listens to HTTP and resizes Spanner resources accordingly.**
