# Chapter 4

Understand how images are used to create instances of VMs and how VMs are organized in projects.
Instances run images, which contain operating systems, libraries, and other code. When you create an instance, you specify a project to contain the instance.

Know that GCP has multiple geographic regions and regions have one or more zones.
VMs run in zones. A region is a geographical location, such as asia-east1, europe-west2, and us-east4. The zones within a region are linked by low-latency, high-bandwidth network connections.

Understand what preemptible VMs are and when they are appropriate to use.
Also understand when not to use them. GCP offers an option called a preemptible VM for workloads that can be disrupted without creating problems.

Understand the difference between the App Engine standard and flexible environments.
The standard environment runs a language-specific platform, and the App Engine flexible environment allows you to run custom containers.

Know that Kubernetes is a container orchestration platform.
It also runs containers in a cluster.

Understand Kubernetes.
It provides load balancing, automatic scaling, logging, and node health checks and repair.

Understand Cloud Functions.
This service is used to run programs in response to events, such as file upload or a message being added to a queue.
