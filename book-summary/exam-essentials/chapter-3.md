# Chapter 3

Understand the GCP resource hierarchy.
All resources are organized within your resource hierarchy. You can define the resource hierarchy using one organization and multiple fold- ers and projects. Folders are useful for grouping departments, and other groups manage their projects separately. Projects contain resources such as VMs and cloud storage buckets. Projects must have billing accounts associated with them to use more than free services.

Understand organization policies.
Organization policies restrict resources in the resource hierarchy. Policies include constraints, which are rules that define what can or cannot be done with a resource. For example, a constraint can be set to block access to the serial port on all VMs in a project. Also, understand the policy evaluation process and how to over- ride inherited policies.

Understand service accounts and how they are used.
Service accounts are identities that are not associated with a specific user but can be assigned to a resource, like a VM. Resources that are assigned a service account can perform operations that the service account has per- mission to perform. Understand service accounts and how to create them.

Understand GCP Billing.
GCP Billing must be enabled to use services and resources beyond free services. Billing associates a billing method, such as a credit card or invoicing information, with a project. All costs associated with resources in a project are billed to the projectâ€™s billing account. A billing account can be associated with more than one project. You manage your billing through the Billing API.

Know how to enable APIs and create Stackdriver Workspaces.
A convenient form lets you enable APIs you know you will need. You can also show a list of APIs and their status. Stackdriver is a set of services for monitoring, logging, tracing, and debugging applica- tions and resources. To monitor and log data to save into Stackdriver, you need to create a workspace.
